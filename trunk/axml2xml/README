Simple utility to translate Android binary XML files to plain text XML.  This
can be run over any of the ".xml" (really, binary XML) files found in
/system/app/*.apk, including framework-res.apk which contains all the standard
framework layouts.  See http://android-random.googlecode.com for a tarball of
the interesting translations.
